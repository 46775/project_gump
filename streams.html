    <h1><i class="bx bx-link"></i>Streams</h1>
    <p>
      In education, "streams" typically refer to different academic paths or divisions within a school system. Streams
      often emerge as a way to tailor education to students' interests, abilities, or future career goals. Here are a
      few
      common examples:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>Subject Streams: In some educational systems, students are divided into different streams based on the
        subjects
        they choose to study. For example, there might be streams for science, arts, commerce, or vocational subjects.
        This allows students to focus on subjects that align with their interests and career aspirations.</li>

      <li>Ability Streams: In some cases, students are placed into streams based on their academic abilities or
        performance levels. This might involve grouping students into advanced, standard, or remedial streams, with each
        stream receiving instruction tailored to their needs.</li>

      <li>Language Streams: In multilingual or international education systems, students may be grouped into language
        streams based on their proficiency in different languages. For example, there might be streams for native
        speakers
        of the local language, as well as streams for students who are learning the language as a second or additional
        language.</li>

      <li>Specialized Streams: Some schools offer specialized streams focused on particular areas of study or career
        paths, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) streams, performing arts streams, or
        sports streams. These streams provide students with in-depth instruction and opportunities in their chosen
        field.
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      The use of streams in education can have both benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, streams can allow for more
      personalized learning experiences and better alignment with students' interests and abilities. On the other
      hand,
      they can perpetuate inequalities and limit opportunities for students who are placed in lower-level streams. As
      such, educators often strive to create inclusive and flexible educational systems that accommodate diverse
      student
      needs and aspirations.
